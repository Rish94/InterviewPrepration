      <h4 id="headTips">Technical Interview</h4>
      <ol id="tipslist">
        <li>Do your research. Look up information about the work being done at the company. This can often provide clues about the skills they will be looking for in a new employee. Also, be sure to read the job description thoroughly. The job posting will likely include a list of skills that the employer expects all applicants to have.</li>
        <li>Brush up on your basics. If it’s been awhile since you’ve taken an algorithms or data structures class, review the material! Everyone gets rusty with skills they don’t use everyday.</li>
        <li>Practice whiteboarding. It is very likely that you will be asked to code live on a whiteboard during your technical interview. If you aren’t used to working/problem solving in front of others, have a couple of friends watch while you solve some practice questions on a whiteboard.</li>
        <li>Be ready to discuss your resume in depth. The interviewer isn’t going to just ask about what you did in previous jobs or projects. They are going to want to hear about challenges you faced, failures you overcame, successes that you are particularly proud of, leadership roles you took on, etc.</li>
        <li>The morning of your interview, choose your outfit accordingly. In addition to assessing your ability to answer technical questions, interviewers are also assessing your cultural fit with the company — can they see you working in the company’s environment?</li>
        <li>Take your time. Don’t feel like you have to start working immediately as soon as a question is asked. Take a minute or two to gather your thoughts, think about the ‘big picture’ of the question, and determine how you will set out to solve it. But don’t solve the whole thing in your head! The interviewers will want to see your thought process in action, and it’s safe to assume they aren’t mind readers.</li>
        <li>Communicate. While you are solving a problem, talk through your thought process and the solution at which you arrive. This will show the interviewers exactly how you approached the problem, and if you start to go wrong somewhere, they will be able to catch it and nudge you in the right direction. If you can’t clearly communicate the work that you do, you won’t be considered a strong candidate, even if you come up with the correct solution.</li>
        <li>If you don’t know the answer to a question, be honest and say that you don’t know. It will look worse if you try to fumble your way through an answer. But if you admit to not knowing something, it is important to demonstrate your willingness and interest in learning. Doing some post-interview research and following up with a solution will show that you are invested in the work and eager to broaden your skill set.</li>
        <li>Ask questions. Interviewers want to see that you are engaged in the process and not just going through the motions. If something is confusing, ask for clarification.</li>

      <h4 id="headTips">Resume Prepration</h4>
      <ol id="tipslist">
        <li>Your resume should be limited to one 8.5″ x 11″ page.</li>
        <li>Each section should be clearly identified with its own header.</li>
        <li>Stick to the basic professional fonts: Times New Roman, Arial, Tahoma, etc. Don’t use anything too ornate or blocky. Pick one font and stick with it for the entire resume.</li>
        <li>Font size should be 10 – 12. No more, no less.</li>
        <li>Margins should be no smaller than 0.5″ on all sides.</li>
        <li>No big blocks of text! Use bullet points to summarize your accomplishments.</li>
        <li>List all education and experience in reverse chronological order. Your most recent experiences are usually the most relevant, so they should be listed first.</li>
        <li>White space is your friend. Don’t feel like you need to fill up the entire page, margin to margin, with text. Give the recruiter some breathing room on the page. This will enable them to focus on the important pieces of information, rather than having to search through text to find those pieces.</li>
        <li>Spell check and proofread! Never send out a resume with spelling or grammatical errors. Set your language preference in Microsoft Word to U.S. English so that spell check will pick up any errors.Review tab - Language - Set Proofing Language.</li>
